Sysvik: 

This package is meant for non .rpm and .deb OS. We offer packages for Rhel, Fedora, SuSE, Centos and other .rpm based distros and 
Debian, Ubuntu and other .deb based distros. Please use them instead of this package.

This package is meant for other distros like AIX and Slackware.

1. Installation

  - Uncompress and unpack with tar/gunzip ex: gunzip sysvik-version.tar.gz and tar -xvf sysvik-version.tar
  - Run install.sh as root

2. Registering (Only for fresh install)
  - Run sysvik -r to register this node to sysvik

3. Install to cron
  - Install.sh will try to install sysvik to cron. If that fails you will need to do it manually. Look at the sysvik.cron file and
    install it to the cron.d or add the information to "crontab -e". Please consult to your distros manuals for how the cron works.

4. Startup scripts
  - We need to startup one service, sysvik-data. Sysvik offers startup script that will work in most linux distros. Look at 
    init.d/sysvikd. 
  - You can also add the following line to your rc.local file:
    /usr/sbin/sysvik-data -b -q
  - Please run this service after insallation and kill/execute after upgrade.
